Since 2012 and well before this year, more than 7000 children in Mali do not go to school for lack of classrooms.
Faced with such a situation, education being a right for every child, our organization was requested by the highest authorities in the country to fill this institutional vacuum.
This is why this project aims to build six classrooms in the Koulikoro region where there are no problems of insecurity before continuing to other regions.
We need very urgent actions so that all the children of the country can go to school otherwise with this situation the rate of radicalization will increase which is not likely to bring peace to a country already bruised for already years .
By building schools, children will be safe from people who want to bring them into the terrorist field.
